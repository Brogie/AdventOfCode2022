This year I am learning python with advent of code, I am also adding in automation tools to assist in solving solutions 
faster.

To auto download and set up a puzzle simply run `python main.py 3` where 3 is the day you want to solve, it will auto 
download your input text file and ask you to paste in the sample provided.
